abstract: Medical imaging is considered one of the most important advances in the
  history of medicine and has become an essential part of the diagnosis and treatment
  of patients. Earlier prediction and treatment have been driving the acquisition
  of higher image resolutions as well as the fusion of different modalities, raising
  the need for sophisticated hardware and software systems for medical image registration,
  storage, analysis, and processing. In this scenario and given the new clinical pipelines
  and the huge clinical burden of hospitals, these systems are often required to provide
  both highly accurate and real-time processing of large amounts of imaging data.
  Additionally, lowering the prices of each part of imaging equipment, as well as
  its development and implementation, and increasing their lifespan is crucial to
  minimize the cost and lead to more accessible healthcare. This paper focuses on
  the evolution and the application of different hardware architectures (namely, CPU,
  GPU, DSP, FPGA, and ASIC) in medical imaging through various specific examples and
  discussing different options depending on the specific application. The main purpose
  is to provide a general introduction to hardware acceleration techniques for medical
  imaging researchers and developers who need to accelerate their implementations.
