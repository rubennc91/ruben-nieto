abstract: Power-Line Communications (PLC) often employ Wavelet Orthogonal Frequency
  Division Multiplexing (OFDM), improving communications through the PLC channel and
  providing broadband links. Since one of the main drawbacks is the noisy and interfering
  PLC channel, to deal with this, the receiver typically includes a channel estimator
  and equalizer. This increases the computational load and complexity of that receiver,
  making it difficult to achieve a feasible architecture for real-time implementations.
  In this work a heterogeneous SoC (System-on- Chip) architecture is proposed for
  an Filter-Bank Multi-Carrier (FBMC) receiver in PLC that carries out the corresponding
  channel estimation and equalization at the reception stage. The obtained experimental
  results include the evaluation of the time consumed by each part of the algorithm
  in the software part, as well as the resource consumption obtained by the proposal
  for a Zynq 7000 SoC device.
