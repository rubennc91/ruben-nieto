Electronic design is a complex activity in which the engineer not only has to be able to understand and analyse an electronic circuit, but is faced with the challenge of creating an electronic system from predetermined specifications. 

Therefore, design is a more advanced stage in learning and the skills acquired are of a higher order. Because electronic design encompasses a very wide number of methodologies and tools, this course focuses on the design of digital electronic systems. 

The course begins by introducing computer architecture, microcontrollers, embedded systems and programmable logic devices such as FPGAs. This knowledge allows to evaluate which technology is more suitable for the system to be implemented. 

Then, the design methodologies of digital electronic systems, the design support tools and the hardware description language VHDL are presented. 

Finally, the practical implementation of blocks such as counters, registers, interfaces, state machines and memories is shown. With these blocks it is possible to design components of certain complexity such as timers, communication interfaces, VGA display controllers and simple video games. The course is practice-oriented, where theoretical concepts are taught to help solve design problems. 

In order to make good use of the course it will be necessary to have previous knowledge acquired in the subjects Digital Electronics, Analog Electronics and Electrical Circuits. In addition, it is necessary to have understood the main concepts taught in the subjects of Electrical Engineering, Electronic Technology and Digital Electronic Systems.
