abstract: In state estimation, adjusting the process noise covariance matrix is an
  important and often difficult task. Well-known methods use the innovation vector
  to perform an adaptive adjustment, but when using event-based sensors, the innovation
  vector is not available for the estimator. We propose an online method for adjusting
  the process noise covariance matrix using the expected and observed event rates,
  which is based on the golden section search optimization algorithm. Simulation results
  confirm the suitability and efficiency of our proposed method. The process noise
  covariance parameter converges to the actual covariance iteratively, reducing the
  sensor transmission rate and the estimation error.
