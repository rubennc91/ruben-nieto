 abstract = {Power-line communication (PLC) systems are used for data transmission through the mains. The deployment of intelligent networks and the high demand for broadband communications have made this technology spread worldwide in recent years. Multicarrier modulations, such as filter-bank multicarrier (FBMC), allow broadband links to be achieved by improving intercarrier interference, at the cost of adding complexity to the system. Nevertheless, the main disadvantage of PLC is the medium, commonly with significant noise and interference. To compensate these effects inserted by the channel, channel estimators and equalizers are often included at the reception stage, at the expense of increasing the computational load and complexity of the resulting receiver. This article proposes a hardware/software (HW/SW) architecture for the real-time implementation of an FBMC transmultiplexer with a channel estimator and an L-Adaptive sine/cosine modulated filter bank equalizer for transmultiplexers (L-ASCET) equalizer. The FBMC transmultiplexer and the L-ASCET equalizer are implemented in HW, whereas the channel estimation and the determination of the equalizer coefficients are specified in SW, all forming a system-on-chip architecture. The performance provided by the proposal has been evaluated in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio, the root-mean-square error, and the bit error rate.},
