summary: Bachelors Degree in Chemical Engineering.
abstract: "This course is the only one in the entire degree that deals with electrical, electronic and automatic engineering. Given the increasing the growing presence of these subjects in all fields of engineering, it is essential to have a minimum knowledge and competences on this subject. minimum knowledge and skills on this subject are essential. The objective of this course is, therefore, to provide the student with the basic fundamentals of electrical engineering and electronic engineering. engineering and electronic engineering, both digital and analog, as well as notions of automatic regulation. regulation. The aim is not only to familiarize the student with the basic theoretical concepts, but also with the real and daily applications that will be found in the exercise of his profession. in the exercise of their profession. The interdisciplinary nature intrinsic to any field of engineering means that the relationship between chemical engineering and that the relationship between chemical engineering and electrical, electronic and/or automatic engineering cannot be made without knowledge of these subjects. knowledge of these subjects, which are basic tools in the development of the profession. This course is therefore Therefore, this course is necessary to achieve one of the general objectives of the degree, defined as to attain knowledge in the design of processes and products, including the processes and products, including the conception, calculation, analysis, construction, commissioning and operation of equipment and equipment and installations where processes with changes of composition, state or energy content are carried out, characteristic of the chemical industry and other related sectors such as pharmaceutical, biotechnological, food or environmental. environmental. The necessary fundamentals are physics, especially electricity and magnetism, the concepts of which are essential, and mathematics. and mathematics, especially the topics of complex numbers, vectors, solving systems of equations and calculus. of systems of equations and differential and integral calculus, subjects that have been covered previously and that must be handled with fluency, both in terms of concepts and concepts and operations. This subject provides basic knowledge for other subjects such as Engineering Projects, fourth year, first semester."
