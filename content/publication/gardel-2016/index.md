abstract: This paper describes the configuration of a networked control system with
  multiple distributed cameras as edge nodes of a cyber-physical system. The proposed
  architecture deploys multiple distributed on computer vision edge nodes capturing
  the motion of mobile robots to interact with people on the environment. The camera
  nodes, network devices and mobile robots are considered part of the same control
  loop. Our approach provides a flexible scalable architecture that balances accuracy
  and reliability of the cyber-physical system, taking advantage of video processing
  on intermediate networked nodes and providing new functions and capabilities with
  minor changes. Main contribution of this paper is to configure the computer vision
  nodes considering the networked control loop with an adjustable sampling period
  to achieve the desired performance controlling the trajectory of multiple robots.
  Different tests have been done on a smart space as an end application framework.
