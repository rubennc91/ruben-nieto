abstract: "Smart grids are a concept that is becoming a concrete reality in developed\
  \ countries, and is only just emerging in developing countries. In both cases, they\
  \ are transforming the customers' relationship with electricity in unexpected ways.\
  \ In this work, it is shown an overview of some functionalities that will be developed\
  \ within the smart grids, which have a common denominator: the use of non-intrusive\
  \ load monitoring techniques. Some of these new functionalities have special relevance\
  \ in the electrical networks of developing countries which present complex challenges\
  \ and need to be updated fast. There are also some of the features that will be\
  \ shown to present great challenges in developed countries at present, but which\
  \ will be of interest in the future in the rest of the world."
