# Welcome to ExoSen-SoC project

The exoskeletons developed provide assistance to the patient's lower extremities and are used in gait rehabilitation with elderly patients or people with spinal cord or neurodegenerative injuries. However, gait is a coordinated movement of the lower extremities, where the exoskeleton can feel like an obstacle in the rehabilitation process. To avoid this, it is necessary to monitor the patient's movement intention through the muscle signals of the lower extremities, in order to improve patient-robot interoperability.

In order to know and monitor the patient's physiological information, the signals coming from EMG sensors distributed by the lower extremities will be taken into account, achieving a real-time processing of them. In order to support the high computational load involved, FPGA hardware architectures will be developed, which provide design flexibility and a significant degree of parallelism. Some SoC devices integrate one or more processors together with the FPGA, so that by combining both parts it is possible to elaborate heterogeneous or mixed HW/SW architectures. Such architecture should be as modular as possible to adapt to the number of signals to be processed, as well as to provide the information to the control of the exoskeletons.

Therefore, this project aims to design efficient architectures based on SoC for the use of EMG sensors that contribute to improve the control of exoskeletons for lower limb rehabilitation.
